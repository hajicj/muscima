    """This class represents the state of the MIDI pitch inference
    engine during inference.

    Reading pitch is a stateful operations. One needs to remember
    how stafflines and staffspaces map to pitch codes. This is governed
    by two things:

    * The clef, which governs
    * The accidentals: key signatures and inline accidentals.

    Clef and key signature have unlimited scope which only changes when
    a new key signature is introduced (or the piece ends). The key
    signature affects all pitches in the given step class (F, C, G, ...)
    regardless of octave. Inline accidentals have scope until the next
    measure separator, and they are only valid within their own octave.

    The pitch inference algorithm is run for each staff separately.

    Base pitch representation
    -------------------------

    The base pitch corresponds to the pitch encoded by a notehead
    simply sitting on the given staffline/staffspace, without any
    regard to accidentals (key signature or inline). It is computed
    by *distance from center staffline* of a staff, with positive
    distance corresponding to going *up* and negative for going *down*
    from the center staffline.

    Accidentals representation
    --------------------------

    The accidentals are associated also with each staffline/staffspace,
    as counted from the current center. (This means i.a. that
    the octave periodicity is 7, not 12.)

    There are two kinds of accidentals based on scope: key signature,
    and inline. Inline accidentals are valid only up to the next
    measure_separator, while key signature accidentals are valid
    up until the key signature changes. Key signature accidentals
    also apply across all octaves, while inline accidentals only apply
    on the specific staffline.

    Note that inline accidentals may *cancel* key signature
    accidentals: they override the key signature when given.

    Key accidentals are given **mod 7**.

    Pitch inference procedure
    -------------------------

    Iterate through the relevant objects on a staff, sorted left-to-right
    by left edge.

    graph. To get the MIDI, there are two streams of information
    that need to be combined: pitches and onsets, where the onsets
    are necessary both for ON and OFF events.

    Pitch inference is done through the ``infer_pitches()`` method.

    Onsets inference is done in two stages. First, the durations
    of individual notes (and rests) are computed, then precedence
    relationships are found and based on the precedence graph
    and durations, onset times are computed.

    Onset inference
    ---------------

    Onsets are computed separately by measure, which enables time
    signature constraint checking.

    (This can be implemented in the precedence graph structure,
    by (a) not allowing precedence edges to cross measure separators,
    (b) chaining measure separators, or it can be implemented
    directly in code. The first option is way more elegant.)

    Creating the precedence graph
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * Get measure separators.
    * Chain measure separators in precedence relationships.
    * Group cropobjects by bins between measure separators.
    * For each staff participating in the current measure
      (as defined by the relevant measure separator outlinks):

        * Infer precedence between the participating notes & rests,
        * Attach the sources of the resulting DAG to the leftward
          measure_separator (if there is none, just leave them
          as sources).

    Invariants
    ^^^^^^^^^^

    * There is exactly one measure separator starting each measure,
      except for the first measure, which has none. That implies:
      when there are multiple disconnected barlines marking the interface
      of the same two measures within a system, they are joined under
      a single measure_separator anyway.
    * Staff groupings are correct, and systems are read top-down.

    def infer_precedence(self, cropobjects):
        """This is the most complex part of onset computation.

        The output of this method is a **precedence graph**. The precedence
        graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) consisting of
        :class:`PrecedenceGraphNode` objects. Each node represents some
        musical concept that participates in establishing the onsets
        by having a *duration*. The invariant of the graph is that
        the onset of a node is the sum of the durations on each of its
        predecessor paths to a root node (which has onset 0).

        Not all nodes necessarily have nonzero duration (although these
        nodes can technically be factored out).

        Once the precedence graph is formed, then a breadth-first search
        (rather than DFS, to more easily spot/resolve conflicts at multi-source
        precedence graph nodes) simply accumulates durations.
        Conflicts can be resolved through failing (currently implemented),
        or looking up possible errors in assigning durations and attempting
        to fix them.

        Forming the precedence graph itself is difficult, because
        of polyphonic (and especially pianoform) music. Practically the only
        actual constraint followed throughout music is that *within a voice*
        notes are read left-to-right. The practice of aligning e.g. whole
        notes in an outer voice to the beginning of the bar rather than
        to the middle took over only cca. 1800 or later.

        An imperfect but overwhelmingly valid constraint is that notes taking
        up a certain proportion of the measure are not written to the *right*
        of the proportional horizontal span in the measure corresponding
        to their duration in time. However, this is *not* uniform across
        the measure: e.g., if the first voice is 2-8-8-8-8 and the second
        is 2-2, then the first half can be very narrow and the second
        quite wide, with the second lower-voice half-note in the middle
        of that part. However, the *first* lower-voice half-note will
        at least *not* be positioned in the horizontal span where
        the 8th notes in the upper voice are.

        Which CropObjects participate in the precedence graph?
        ------------------------------------------------------

        We directly derive precedence graph nodes from the following
        CropObjects:

        * Noteheads: empty, full, and grace noteheads of both kinds, which
          are assigned duration based on their type (e.g., quarter, 16th, etc.)
          and then may be further modified by duration dots and/or tuples.
        * Rests of all kinds, which get duration via a simple table based
          on the rest class and tuple/dot modification.
        * Measure separators, which get a duration of 0.

        The assumption of our symbol classes is that there are no rests
        shorter than 64th.

        Furthermore, we add synthetic nodes representing:

        * Root measure separator, with duration 0 **and** onset 0,
          which initializes the onset computations along the graph
        * Measure nodes, with durations derived from time signatures
          valid for the given measures.

        Constructing the precedence graph
        ---------------------------------

        We factor the precedence graph into measures, and then infer precedence
        for each measure separately, in order to keep the problem tractable
        and in order for errors not to propagate too far. The inference
        graph construction algorithm is therefore split into two steps:

        * Construct the "spine" of the precedence graph from measure nodes,
        * Construct the single-measure precedence subgraphs (further factored
          by staff).

        The difficulties lie primarily in step 2.

        (Note that ties are currently disregarded: the second note
        of the tie normally gets an onset. After all, conceptually,
        it is a separate note with an onset, it just does not get played.)

        Precedence graph spine
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The **spine** of the precedence graph is a single path of alternating
        ``measure_separator`` and ``measure`` nodes. ``measure_separator``
        nodes are constructed from the CropObjects, and ``measure`` nodes
        are created artificially between consecutive ``measure_separator``
        nodes. The measure separator nodes have a duration of 0, while
        the duration of the measure nodes is inferred from the time signature
        valid for that measure. An artificial root measure_separator node
        is created to serve as the source of the entire precedence graph.

        Thus, the first part of the algorithm is, at a high level:

        * Order measure separators,
        * Assign time signatures to measures and compute measure durations
          from time signatures.

        **Gory details:** In step 1, we assume that systems are ordered
        top-down in time, that all systems are properly grouped using
        ``staff_grouping`` symbols, that measure separators are strictly
        monotonous (i.e., the same subset of possible onsets belongs to
        the i-th measure on each staff, which is an assumption that does
        *not* hold for isorhythmic motets and basically anything pre-16th
        century).

        In step 2, we assume that time signatures are always written within
        the measure that *precedes* the first measure for which they are
        valid, with the exception of the first time signature on the system.

        We also currently assume that a given measure has the same number
        of beats across all staves within a system (so: no polytempi for now).

        Measure subgraphs
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        There are again two high-level steps:

        * Assign other onset-carrying objects (noteheads and rests)
          to measures, to prepare the second phase that iterates over
          these groups per measure (and staff).
        * For each measure group, compute the subgraph and attach
          its sources to the preceding measure separator node.

        The first one can be resolved easily by looking at (a) staff
        assignment, (b) horizontal position with respect to measure
        separators. Noting that long measure separators might not
        really be straight, we use the intersection of the separator
        with the given staff.

        The second step is the difficult one. We describe the algorithm
        for inferring precedence, simultaneity span minimization,
        in a separate section.


        Simultaneity span minimization
        ------------------------------

        Inferring precedence in polyphonic music is non-trivial, especially
        if one wants to handle handwritten music, and even more so when
        extending the scope before the 1800s. We infer precedence using
        the principle that notes which are supposed to be played together
        should be as close to each other horizontally as possible: from
        all the possible precedence assignments that fulfill notation
        rule constraints, choose the one which minimizes the horizontal
        span assigned to each unit of musical time in the bar.

        The algorithm is initialized as follows:

        * Determine the shortest subdivision of the measure (in beats)
          which has to be treated independently. This generally corresponds
          to the shortest note in the measure.
        * Initialize the assignment table: for each onset-carrying object,
          we will assign it to one of the time bins.

        There are some rules of music notation that we use to prune the space
        of possible precedence assignments by associating the notes (or rests)
        into blocks:

        * Beamed groups without intervening rests
        * Tied note pairs
        * Notes that share a stem
        * Notes within a tuple

        Rests within beamed groups (e.g., 8th - 8th_rest - 8th) are a problem.
        A decision needs to be made whether the rest does belong to the group
        or not.

        Dealing with numeric time signatures
        ------------------------------------

        * Is there both a numerator and a denominator?
          (Is the time sig. "fractional"?)
           * If there is a letter_other child, then yes; use the letter_other
             symbol to separate time signature into numerator (top, left) and
             denominator regions.
           * If there is no letter_other child, then check if there is sufficient
             vertical separation between some groups of symbols. Given that it
             is much more likely that there will be the "fractional" structure,
             we say:

               If the minimum vertical IoU between two symbols is more than
               0.8, we consider the time signature non-fractional.

             (The threshold can be controlled through the
             FRACTIONAL_VERTICAL_IOU_THRESHOLD parameter.)

        * If yes: assign numerals to either num. (top), or denom. (bottom)
        * If not: assume the number is no. of beats. (In some scores, the
          base indicator may be attached in form of a note instead of a
          denumerator, like e.g. scores by Janacek, but we ignore this for now.
          In early music, 3 can mean "tripla", which is 3/2.)

    Should be agnostic w.r.t. the chosen MIDI representation?

    Assumes all noteheads have corresponding pitch, onset & duration
    information. The alignment is basically finding how beats
    translate to time in the MIDI file. For a "dead" rendered
    MIDI, this is easy, since (assuming a constant tempo) there
    is a constant ratio. For a MIDI performance, this may be much
    more difficult.

    Assuming the events are at least in the correct
    order, we can use Dynamic Time Warping, using only pitch matching
    as the cost function as the simplest baseline.

    The ``m`` element of each returned item is then the onset time
    in the MIDI, in ticks. This way, the alignment algorithm is fully
    independent of the representation one chooses for the MIDI data,
    while extracting the relevant information.

    For real performances with errors, one would have to use pitch *distance*
    as the cost function, and incorprate the time differences into
    the cost function in order to decide which events to align
    to noteheads even though they may be errors, and which to leave
    unaligned. Then, we would also have to output the full info of
    the corresponding MIDI event.
